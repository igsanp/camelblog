I decided to start a personal blog, because I wanted to write about topics like programming languages and compilers from a not programming expert.

I wanted to write pieces of information, without deadlines weekly and let readers if she or he wishes to read them.

This blog is not totally about programming, it includes topics(tags) like music and other themes that i like it.
